### 🛠️ Technical Philosophy
This project is built on a **"Zero-Knowledge"** architecture. It operates entirely in the client-side browser to ensure maximum privacy for sensitive user data.

* **No Database:** We utilize `LocalStorage` for data persistence. User journals never leave the device.
* **No Frameworks:** Built with Vanilla JavaScript for maximum performance and near-instant load times on mobile networks.
* **Lazy-Loaded Audio:** The Mood Engine utilizes the Web Audio API to fetch audio assets only when needed, keeping the initial bundle size small.

### 🔒 Privacy
* **Analytics:** GA4 (Anonymized IP, No User-ID tracking).
* **Data:** 100% Client-Side.
